jgmenu v4.5.0 release notes
===========================

Updates since v4.4.1
--------------------

  * Add config option `search_empty_string` so that the default '<empty>'
    can be overridden. (#232)

  * Ignore entries with empty commands when de-duplicating search results. This
    makes a search for "aa" with the csv data below render two results rather
    than one. (#227)

        a,
        aa,
        aaa,
        b,
        bb,
        bbb,

  * jgmenu-apps: add config options `--prepend-file` and `--append-file` (#215)

  * Do not focus any item on launch/awake to increase consistency with most
    other menus (#209)

  * Make `librsvg` dependency optional. Also support both `2.40.x` and newer.

  * Escape special characters (`<`, `>` and `&`) in @search widget to render
    correctly with pango markup. (#194)

  * contrib/xfce4-panel:

      * Fix xfce4-panel registration. Thanks-to: @fweimer-rh

      * Add `X-XFCE-API=2.0` to .desktop file to make the plugin work with the
        latest xfce4-panel

  * jgmenu-apps: handle name and generic-name containing commas (#192)

  * Fix widgets button-release bug by not executing widget action on button
    release if pointer has moved outside widget area since pressed (#189)
